### Why must we choose you?

Simply put, I love coding. Well, so does everybody here. So what makes me different? Firstly I commit myself to a task no matter how tedious it is. Nothing can convince me that making projects is boring. Next, I have a good chunk of creative thinking skills and I take interest in writing and direction. I may not have the knowledge of all the programming languages out there yet but I intend to give my all to learn them. I adore the idea of 'open source software' and how helpful everyone in the community is. Which is why I want to join this club so that I can be of help. I want to be able to think of creative and efficient solutions for any problem that I face.

As a Senior S3 student, I have experience in working for some dotnet development projects for Vipin Sir, I would like to join the club to further contribute to any projects I am tasked with.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?

My plan for the next 6 months is very straightforward, attend as many hackathons and conferences as I can, and improve my web-dev skills while also improving my gpa for this year.

### How would you contribute back to the club?

I have very good improvisation and oratory skills and I have a lot of experience in making fluid and attention grabbing presentations so I plan on volunteering for speaking in workshops or regular meetings for a project. I also want to revive the amFOSS podcast and also try and innovate some other means of increasing the nation-wide reach of the club. 

### Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
I love the selection process and how it resonates the personality of the club. But I don't like how they follow the same format every Year.
