This task was the hardest of them all. Not only did I have to work around learning basic flutter, I also had to use the flame module somehow. Thankfully I found a youtube tutorial on flame, which eased the process a little bit. Even so, I ended up spending 6 days on this task. With some tweaking here and there I managed to make it work but not perfectly.
